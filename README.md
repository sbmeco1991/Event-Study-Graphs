Event Study Graphs 

One of the modern approaches of analyzing the validity of parallel trends assumption is through event study designs.

Here I have showed a couple of ways to compute event study graphs in Stata. Also, I have shown how to create lags and leads for a combined number of periods in Stata.

Lastly, I have added some cool literatures on panel event study methods and some figures showing how these graphs look.
